= 1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 removes all deprecated features.  If you are upgrading from a
version prior to 0.10.0 you will need to make changes to your code before it
will work with BinData 1.0.0 or later.

It is recommended to first upgrade to 0.11.1, and run your code with the -w
command line switch.  This will turn on warning messages that should give you
hints about which parts of your code need changing.  See the NEWS for 0.10.0
for details of the deprecated features.

= 0.10.0

There are several new features in this release.  The major ones are:

* Debugging declarations is now easier with the ability to trace values when
  reading.

      BinData::trace_reading(STDERR) do
        obj_not_quite_working_correctly.read(io)
      end

  Will result in a debugging trace written to STDERR.

* Support for arbitrary sized integers and bit fields.

* Struct/Array field/element access now returns a BinData object, rather than
  the underlying Fixnum or String.  The BinData object will behave like it's
  underlying primitive so existing code should continue to work.  This allows
  for an improved syntax in your declarations.

  If your code requires access to the underlying primitive, you can access it
  with the #value method.

There are several deprecations and one backwards incompatible change in this
release.  Turn on $VERBOSE mode (-w command line switch) to see warnings
regarding these deprecations.

== IMPORTANT - Ruby does not warn you about this change!

* The #to_s method for getting the binary string representation of a data
  object has been renamed to #to_binary_s.  If you use this method you must
  manually change your code or you will get strange results.

== Deprecations.  Ruby will warn you of these when in $VERBOSE mode.

Code using these deprecated features will still work in this release but will
fail to work in some future release.  Change your code now.

* BinData::SingleValue has been renamed to BinData::Primitive.

* BinData::MultiValue has been renamed to BinData::Record.

* String :trim_value parameter has been renamed to :trim_padding.

* Registry.instance should be replaced with RegisteredClasses.

* struct.offset_of("field") should be replaced with struct.field.offset.

* struct.clear("field") should be replaced with struct.field.clear.

* struct.clear?("field") should be replaced with struct.field.clear?.

* struct.num_bytes("field") should be replaced with struct.field.num_bytes.

* array.clear(n) should be replaced with array[n].clear.

* array.clear?(n) should be replaced with array[n].clear?.

* array.num_bytes(n) should be replaced with array[n].num_bytes.
