This package is designed to be installed with rubygems.  If you don't
have rubygems installed on your system, the older setup.rb is
included as a convenience.

  ($ su)
  # ruby setup.rb

This simple step installs bindata under the default location for Ruby
libraries.  You can also customize the installation by supplying some
options to setup.rb.
Try "ruby setup.rb --help".
